Automatically Generate a PDF and send it by Email

## Problem statement
you work for a company that sells second hand cars. Management wants to get a summary of the amounts of vehicles that have been sold at the end of every month. The company already has a web service which serves sales data at the end of every month but management wants an email to be sent out with an attached PDF so that data is more easily readable.

## Goals Achieved
* Wrote a script that summarizes and processes sales data into different categories
* Generated a PDF using Python
* Automatically sent a PDF by email
